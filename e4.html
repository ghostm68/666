      <h1>The Rules of Chess</h1>
      <p>Chess is a two-player strategy game played on a checkered gameboard. The gameboard consists of 64 squares arranged in an 8x8 grid.</p>
      <p>Each player begins the game with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The goal of the game is to checkmate the other player's king. This occurs when the king is in a position to be captured (in "check") and there is no way to move the king out of capture (mate).</p>
      <p>Players move their pieces according to specific rules. The rook can move any number of squares along a rank or file. The bishop can move any number of squares diagonally. The queen can move any number of squares along a rank, file, or diagonal. The king can move one square in any direction. The knight moves to any of the squares immediately adjacent to it, then makes a separate, 90-degree turn and moves to an adjacent square on that line, essentially moving in an "L" shape.</p>
      <p>Other rules of chess include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pawns have the most complex rules of movement and capture. They can move forward to the unoccupied square immediately in front of them on the same file, or on its first move it can advance two squares along the same file provided both squares are unoccupied, or it can capture an opponent's piece on a square diagonally in front of it on an adjacent file, by moving to that square.</li>
        <li>Captured pieces are removed from the game. Pieces are generally captured by moving to the square they occupy.</li>
        <li>The king is never captured, but is said to be "in check" when it is under attack by one or more of the opponent's pieces. The player who has the move must then either move the king to a square where it is not in check, capture the attacking piece, or interpose a piece between the attacking piece and the king.</li>
        <li>When a player makes a move that puts the opponent's king in check, the move is announced by saying "check".</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>Highly Regarded Opening Moves</h1>
      <p>One of the most highly regarded opening moves in chess is the Ruy Lopez. It is named after the Spanish bishop Ruy LÃ³pez de Segura, who wrote one of the earliest books on chess. The Ruy Lopez is a chess opening played by White, who moves the king's pawn two squares forward, then the king's knight to the square next to the pawn. Black responds by moving their pawn in front of the king's knight.</p>
      <p>Other highly regarded opening moves include the Sicilian Defense, the Italian Game, and the French Defense.</p>
